Hi! My name is Henrique. I'm a machine learning engineer at Google currently working on natural language understanding (neural semantic parsing, question answering, and information retrieval). We research, design, implement, and deploy the query understanding model for Google Search.

Previously, I worked on other semantic parsing models for Google Search, created voice queries for electric vehicles in Google Assistant, and shipped features as a product manager at [Landed](https://gotlanded.com).

I recently graduated from [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) with a B.S.E. in Computer Science and minors in Applied Math, Optimization, and Statistics & Machine Learning. I conducted research in natural language processing (pruning, embeddings, song recommendation, cannabis strains) and theoretical CS (learning, auctions, tournaments). My senior thesis was advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/), and my junior independent work was advised by [Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/fellbaum) and [Jéremie Lumbroso](https://github.com/jlumbroso).

I am half Paraguayan and half Brazilian, and grew up in [Asunción](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n) speaking four languages (Spanish, Portuguese, Guaraní, and English).
